A simple start webpage.

# What?
SimpleSearch is a simple start webpage for users who want a clean start experience. It is not a search engine in and of itself, only a webpage that redirects your request to your favorite search engine.

# How can I set it up?
If you want to host an instance on the web, download or clone this project, then install a HTTP server like apache [https://httpd.apache.org/]. Otherwise, simply set file://path/to/index.html as the default page on your browser(s).
